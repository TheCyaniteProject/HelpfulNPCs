# HelpfulNPCs
HelpfulNPCs is a simple mod that adds one thing: Craftable helpful NPCs.
This mod is loosely based on the craftable NPCs from Ancient Warfare 2, but for Forge 1.20.1.
I intend to use this with the Create mod, so expect some compatibility here and there.

Features:
* Craftable Worker NPCs with Dynamically generated textures.
* Workers can carry items between containers, such as grabbing ore from furnaces or placing items on Create depots, ect.

Planned:
* Set NPCs to defend area
* Make the Create: Item Filter compatable with NPC's TargetItem slot.
* Create companion mod that will have the farming/mineing/woodcutting blocks from Ancient Warfare 2 that can be powered by Workers or electricity.
* Maybe some combatibity with Armourer's Workshop?
* Maybe some interaction with MCA: Reborn?
